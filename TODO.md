# TODOs
- [X] Save images in campaign-specific subfolders (getting the campaign name from the campaign config).
- [ ] Store machine-readable test matrix (with image names) + other metadata for use in shutterbug
- [ ] Add command line arguments for campaign name to index.js
- [ ] More/different test functions for mobile banners (go to 2nd page, close banner, etc)
- [ ] More validation of `test_matrix` configuration settings (to prevent developer errors)
- [ ] progress and silent mode: Lower log level for web driver, display progress
