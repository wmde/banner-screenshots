# TODOs
- [ ] Add command line arguments for campaign name, output directory test
	  function, etc to index.js
- [ ] More/different test functions for mobile banners (go to 2nd page, close banner, etc)
- [ ] More validation of `test_matrix` configuration settings (to prevent
	  developer errors)
- [ ] Better error handling when something goes wrong (e.g. during browser
	  setup or in the test function): continue screenshotting the rest of 
	  the cases, mark failed test case as failed in the metadata. 
- [ ] Upload of images and metadata to hosting platform
- [ ] progress and silent mode: Lower log level for web driver, display test progress
- [ ] Add CI to check if screenshots are still working
