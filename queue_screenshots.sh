# This shell script allows to run the queue_screenshots CLI inside the docker
# container of the first screenshot worker, That is necessary/convenient,
# because otherwise we'd have to build a standalone docker image for that and
# would have to pass the network created by docker-compose to that docker image
# when running it, to be able to access RabbitMQ inside the docker environment.

# When we run the screenshot tool as part of CI (see https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T302624 )
# we'll have a dedicated docker image and some way to get to the RabbitMQ network.
